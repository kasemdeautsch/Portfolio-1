                <h2>History of Syria</h2>
                <p>Syria has a long and complex history dating back to ancient civilizations. The region has been home
                    to various empires and cultures throughout the centuries.</p>
                <p>
                    The history of Syria covers events which occurred on the territory of the present Syrian Arab
                    Republic and events which occurred in the region of Syria. Throughout ancient times the territory of
                    present Syrian Arab Republic was occupied and ruled by several empires, including the Sumerians,
                    Mitanni, Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Hittites, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Arameans, Amorites,
                    Persians, Greeks and Romans.[1] Syria is considered to have emerged as an independent country for
                    the first time on 24 October 1945, upon the signing of the United Nations Charter by the Syrian
                    government, effectively ending France's mandate by the League of Nations to "render administrative
                    advice and assistance to the population" of Syria, which came in effect in April 1946(<a

                </p>
                <h2>Ancient History</h2>
                <p>Syria was part of the cradle of civilization, with evidence of settlements dating back to 10,000 BCE.
                    It was home to ancient kingdoms such as Ebla and Mari[1].</p>
                <h2>Modern Era</h2>
                <p>Syria gained independence from France in 1946. Since then, it has experienced significant political
                    changes and conflicts that have shaped its modern history[1].</p>
